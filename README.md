# Shoresy Bot (nsfw)
Discord Bot for Shorsey from Letterkenny

## Info
I'm creating this bot for discord so that when you call it via a command in discord chat, he will use one of his many insults and return fire.

## Current Progress
ShoresyBot will now reply with insults defined in quotes.js.

It currently replaces the following strings when run:
'replyUser' - replaces with message.author.username (Username of discord account who called the bot)
'randomUser1'/'randomUser2' - replaces with random name from names array

## Future Additions
I will add a way for someone to add quotes if they find new ones they want
Declare names array as empty array and have the end users push new ones in with a command
